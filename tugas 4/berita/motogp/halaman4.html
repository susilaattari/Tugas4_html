    <h2>V for Velocità: can Ducati keep the momentum at Mugello?</h2>
    <p>Would you have predicted this in Qatar? The gossip went into overdrive back in the desert as Ducati didn't win either of the season openers at one of their "favourite" or most successful tracks, but now the factory can enjoy its elegant silence on the matter even more. Two 1-2s in a row, with Jack Miller (Ducati Lenovo Team) on the top step in both and Francesco Bagnaia (Ducati Lenovo Team) and Johann Zarco (Pramac Racing) taking a second place apiece, make quite a statement. The three are all in the top four in the standings too – something Ducati have never had before – and Bagnaia is only a point off the lead. That would be enough to grab some attention in itself but the next track up, unfortunately for the rest, is also the Autodromo Internazionale del Mugello.</p>
